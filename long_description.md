## WHAT & WHY

This project shows how you can use PyBossa technology to identify sounds on an audio clip, selecting where it starts and where it ends, and tagging it from a set of predifined list of possible sounds.

This template is built to help researchers, journalists, civic hackers to identify sounds in an audio. The idea is that you have an audio file (or several) where there could be:

 * Birds singing: and you need to idenfify which species is signing,
 * Noise on a city: and you need to identify which sounds can be heard (breaks, cars, trains, sirens),
 * Audio conversations: and you need to identify the person, language, dialect that's on the record,
 * etc.

The project is using the [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org/) project, as they provide nice visualizations of the audio clips. However, you can use our Dropbox integration and use your own sound clips (we also support Soundcloud). For more info, [contact us](mailto:info@scifabric.com).

The project uses HTML5 technology to play the sounds, and allows users to select the specific area where the identified sound is identified. The starting and ending point of that selection plus its tag is saved as the answer.

## HOW

While this is a demo project, it shows how a group of persons can use this template to identify sounds on an audio clip. The idea behind the project is select where the sound is happening (a beep, a person talking, etc.) and writting a description about it.

The browser renders the sound, and the user can play and stop it without problems. Tagging is also very simple, as the project suggest several types of sounds as soon as the volunteer starts to type them in.

With all the answers, then the researchers will be able to train neural networks, validate information on the audios, transcribe the discussions, etc.

## WHO

The project has been created by [Scifabric](http://scifabric.com). The developers of the PyBossa technology as well as the company that hosts Crowdcrafting.org.
